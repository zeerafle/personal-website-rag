# Personal Website RAG

This repository hosts a FastAPI application that implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chain for answering questions. It is designed as part of the personal website project and incorporates various themes and configuration assets.

## Overview

- **Backend API:**
  The core of the application is a FastAPI service defined in [`src/personal_website_rag/__init__.py`](src/personal_website_rag/__init__.py). It exposes an endpoint `/ask` that accepts a question and returns an answer along with source references.

- **RAG Chain:**
  The API leverages a RAG chain implementation imported from [`src/personal_website_rag/rag_chain.py`](src/personal_website_rag/rag_chain.py) (as `qa`) to process queries. This module encapsulates the logic for input transformation, retrieval, and answer generation.

- **Dependencies:**
  The project depends on several libraries including FastAPI, langchain, python-dotenv, and others as specified in [pyproject.toml](pyproject.toml). See the `[project.dependencies]` section for details.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/zeerafle/personal-website-rag.git
   cd personal-website-rag
   ```
2. **Set up a Python Virtual Environment and Install Dependencies with RY:**
   ```bash
   curl -sSf https://rye.astral.sh/get | bash
   rye sync
   ```

## Running the Application

Start the FastAPI server using a command like:

```bash
uvicorn personal_website_rag.app:app --reload
```

This will start the service on `http://127.0.0.1:8000`. You can test the `/ask` endpoint by navigating to the auto-generated API documentation at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs`.

## API Usage

- **Endpoint:** `/ask`
  **Method:** POST
  **Payload Example:**
  ```json
  {
    "question": "What is the purpose of this application?"
  }
  ```
  **Response Example:**
  ```json
  {
    "answer": "Your answer generated by the RAG chain...",
    "sources": ["source_1", "source_2"]
  }
  ```

The endpoint's implementation in app.py demonstrates error handling using FastAPI's HTTP exceptions.

## Project Structure

- **src/**
  Contains the core application code. The FastAPI app and its supporting modules (like the RAG chain in `src/personal_website_rag/rag_chain.py`) live here.

- **.env, pyproject.toml, README.md, etc.:**
  Additional configuration files for the environment, dependencies, and packaging.
