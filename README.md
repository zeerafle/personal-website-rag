# Personal Website RAG

This repository hosts a FastAPI application that implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chain for answering questions. It is designed as part of the personal website project and incorporates various themes and configuration assets.

## Overview

- **Backend API:**
  The core of the application is a FastAPI service defined in [`src/personal_website_rag/app.py`](src/personal_website_rag/app.py). It exposes an endpoint `/ask` that accepts a question and returns an answer along with source references.

- **RAG Chain:**
  The API leverages a RAG chain implementation imported from [`src/personal_website_rag/rag_chain.py`](src/personal_website_rag/rag_chain.py) (as `qa`) to process queries. This module encapsulates the logic for input transformation, retrieval, and answer generation.

- **Dependencies:**
  The project depends on several libraries including FastAPI, langchain, python-dotenv, and others as specified in [pyproject.toml](pyproject.toml). See the `[project.dependencies]` section for details.

- **Build & Packaging:**
  The project is built using Hatch. The target wheel configuration is defined under `[tool.hatch.build.targets.wheel]` in [pyproject.toml](pyproject.toml), ensuring that the package [`src/personal_website_rag`](src/personal_website_rag/app.py) is included.

- **Website Assets:**
  Additional website assets and theming details are maintained in the [`github_data/`](github_data/) directory, which includes files for a Minimal Mistakes Jekyll theme. These assets are useful for local previews and deploying the front-end of your personal website.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/zeerafle/personal-website-rag.git
   cd personal-website-rag
   ```
2. **Set up a Python Virtual Environment:**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```
3. **Install Dependencies:**
   Since the project uses Hatch for building, ensure Hatch is installed:
   ```bash
   pip install hatch
   ```
   Then install the project dependencies via Hatch or by using pip:
   ```bash
   hatch run pip install -e .
   ```
   Alternatively, using pip directly:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.lock
   ```

## Running the Application

Start the FastAPI server using a command like:

```bash
uvicorn personal_website_rag.app:app --reload
```

This will start the service on `http://127.0.0.1:8000`. You can test the `/ask` endpoint by navigating to the auto-generated API documentation at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs`.

## API Usage

- **Endpoint:** `/ask`
  **Method:** POST
  **Payload Example:**
  ```json
  {
    "question": "What is the purpose of this application?"
  }
  ```
  **Response Example:**
  ```json
  {
    "answer": "Your answer generated by the RAG chain...",
    "sources": ["source_1", "source_2"]
  }
  ```

The endpoint's implementation in app.py demonstrates error handling using FastAPI's HTTP exceptions.

## Project Structure

- **src/**
  Contains the core application code. The FastAPI app and its supporting modules (like the RAG chain in `src/personal_website_rag/rag_chain.py`) live here.

- **github_data/**
  Assets related to the website theming and Jekyll configurations. Refer to README.md for guidance on local installation and troubleshooting of the Minimal Mistakes theme.

- **.env, pyproject.toml, README.md, etc.:**
  Additional configuration files for the environment, dependencies, and packaging.

## Build & Distribution

The project supports creating a wheel distribution using Hatch. The configuration for building the wheel is located in pyproject.toml under `[tool.hatch.build.targets.wheel]`.

# Personal Website RAG

This project is a FastAPI service designed to serve a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chain for answering questions. It is part of a personal website that also includes assets for a Minimal Mistakes Jekyll theme.

## Project Overview

- **API Service:**
  The core API is implemented in [`personal_website_rag/app.py`](src/personal_website_rag/app.py). It exposes a single POST endpoint (`/ask`) which accepts a JSON payload with a question and returns an answer along with source information.

- **RAG Chain:**
  The application uses a RAG chain module (imported as `qa` from [`personal_website_rag/rag_chain.py`](src/personal_website_rag/rag_chain.py)) to process and answer queries.

- **Project Manager:**
  This project is built using the [Rye](https://rye-up.com/) project manager. All dependency and configuration management is done via the [`pyproject.toml`](pyproject.toml) file.

- **Website Assets:**
  The repository also includes a Jekyll-based site for portfolio, blog, and college notes under the [`github_data/`](github_data/) folder. This is configured with the Minimal Mistakes theme.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://your-repository-url.git
   cd personal-website-rag
   ```

2. **Install Rye:**
   Follow the instructions on the [Rye website](https://rye-up.com/) to install Rye if you don't have it already.

3. **Install Dependencies:**

   Rye manages your dependencies as specified in the pyproject.toml. To install all required dependencies, run:

   ```bash
   rye sync
   ```

## Running the Application

To start the FastAPI server, use the following command:

```bash
rye run uvicorn personal_website_rag.app:app --reload
```

This will start the server on `http://127.0.0.1:8000`. You can view the interactive API documentation at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs`.

## API Endpoint

- **POST /ask**

  **Payload Example:**
  ```json
  {
    "question": "What is the purpose of this application?"
  }
  ```

  **Response Example:**
  ```json
  {
    "answer": "Your generated answer...",
    "sources": ["source_1", "source_2"]
  }
  ```

  The endpoint is implemented in `personal_website_rag/app.py` and uses error handling to return a `500` status code in case of failure.

## Project Structure

- **src/**
  Contains the FastAPI application and supporting modules.
  - `personal_website_rag/app.py` - Main API entry point.
  - `personal_website_rag/rag_chain.py` - Implements the RAG chain logic.

- **github_data/**
  Contains assets and configuration for a Minimal Mistakes Jekyll theme used for the personal website.

- **pyproject.toml**
  Central configuration file for the project. It includes dependency configuration, project metadata, and build settings for creating the wheel package.

## Building the Project

To build a wheel distribution of the project, use Hatch (configured by the `pyproject.toml`):

```bash
rye run hatch build
```

This command packages the `personal_website_rag` module as specified.
